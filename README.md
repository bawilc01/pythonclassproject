# pythonclassproject
### Christina Foster's Project for May 2020 Python Class
This project takes a look at a couple of fabricated data sets that accurately reflect the types of data sets I use in everyday work. It analyzes the data and produces insights around how Training feedback correlates to key business metrics.

### Installation and Running
1. Clone pythonclassproject repo
2. If not already installed, install pandas, bokeh, scipy, and Jupyter Notebook using pip:
    - `<pip install pandas>`
    - `<pip install bokeh>`
    - `<pip install scipy>`
    - `<pip install notebook>`
3. Run Jupyter Notebooks from terminal with the command:
    - `<jupyter notebook>`
4. Open the pythonclassproject-master/TrainingAnalysisProject.ipynb notebook
5. Click *cell* and *Run All* to run the entire notebook

### Project Requirements
- Imported two CSV files into a data frame, then combined into new data frame
- Ran analyses on the data to display outputs that could be used for decision making, including surface level analyses and more in-depth statistical tests
- Analyzed text and displayed frequency of phrases from the open response, qualitative data
- Defined a function (table_converter) to create x and y axis lists for Bokeh bar graphs, making it easier to reproduce for other data in question
- Added in data visualizations using Bokeh to make trends easier to see and understand (both scatter plots and a bar graph)
- Confirm other requirements met not listed in python project requirements list for using external libraries, analyzing data and displaying data in meaningful way.
